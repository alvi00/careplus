⦁	Flexibility: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, which allows for more flexible updates and easier testing.
⦁	Reduced Risk of System Failure: If one service fails, it does not bring down the entire system, ensuring better uptime.
Challenges:
⦁	Increased Complexity: Developing a microservices architecture is more complex because of the need to manage multiple services, their communication, and the infrastructure.
⦁	Higher Initial Costs: The development process will require more resources in terms of server infrastructure, cloud services, and integration. There may also be more complexity in setting up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
⦁	Security Considerations: With multiple services and APIs, the system must be carefully secured to prevent vulnerabilities during communication between components.



Feasibility Analysis
Solution 1: Monolithic Architecture
⦁	Technical Feasibility: This solution is technically feasible because it involves using common technologies (React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Twilio) that the team is already familiar with. It is easier to set up initially and requires fewer resources.
⦁	Operational Feasibility: This approach is simpler to manage initially, with a single point of control. However, as the platform grows, it may become challenging to scale.
⦁	Financial Feasibility: This approach would be more cost-effective in the short term due to lower infrastructure and development costs. However, long-term costs may increase as the platform scales.
Solution 2: Microservices Architecture
⦁	Technical Feasibility: While this solution is technically feasible and can scale well, it will require more advanced knowledge in handling distributed systems, APIs, and cloud infrastructure.
⦁	Operational Feasibility: The system will require more management due to multiple independent services. However, this is ideal for long-term growth and flexibility.
⦁	Financial Feasibility: This solution will involve higher initial development and infrastructure costs. However, the long-term benefits of scalability and better uptime may justify the higher investment.

Conclusion
